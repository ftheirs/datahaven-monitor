# Benchmark Suite (Placeholder)

This directory is reserved for focused benchmarking scripts that measure timings
for specific parts of the StorageHub workflows (e.g., upload latency, merkle
computation time, or end-to-end flow durations) under controlled conditions.

In the current phase, no benchmark code is implemented yet. Future work will
add TypeScript entrypoints here with clear CLI options so they can be run
locally or in CI as needed.
